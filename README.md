# lzmaSDK

7zip is a useful replacement for zlib and bzip2. In some cases, 7zip can achive drastically better compression ratios than both zlib and bzip2. One can always go to [7-zip.org](http://www.7-zip.org/) to find the source code. This example provides the lzma SDK (release 9.21 beta) configured as an iPhone project.

This repository is a clone of Mo DeJong's work and is here to be integrated in CocoaPods Spec repo. You can find the original packed zip file here: [Example 7](http://www.modejong.com/iOS/).

This repository contains the LZMA SDK customized for an embedded system (iPhone/iOS). Only the file extraction logic was included, all code related to creating compressed streams was removed. Also, CRC validation was removed to improve performance. This is based on **lzma release 9.21 beta**.

**Warning:** There is an issue with the C version of lzma which is used here. Huge archives need a lot of RAM while they are extracted. To lean more, head over to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/12668533/408150).

Embedded version does not need exe branch predictors:

* Bra.c
* Bcj2.c
* Bra86.c

To update to a new version of the LZMA SDK, use the update.tcl to copy over those
